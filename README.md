# üëã Hello!

### A Little About Me

I'm new to the GitHub field, but I'm eager to learn and grow! I started my journey in the programming world in February of this year, learning the basics and making strides. Currently, I'm participating in an artificial intelligence bootcamp at Factoria F5, where I'm exploring new areas and expanding my skills.

### üíª Programming Skills

- **C**: I learned the basics of C during my time at the 42 piscine. Although my knowledge is limited, I'm excited to continue exploring and improving in this language.
- **Python**: I've had the chance to dabble in Python, and I'm enjoying every step I take in this language.

### üß† Passion for Artificial Intelligence

I'm passionate about the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I'm excited to explore how these fields can transform our lives and solve complex problems.

### üê± Cat Lover

I can't forget to mention my love for cats! Spending time with them is one of my favorite activities outside of programming.

### üéÆ Hobbies

I enjoy various hobbies in my free time:

- **Video Games**: I love immersing myself in virtual worlds and exploring new adventures. I'm always on the lookout for new games to play and challenges to overcome.
  
- **Anime**: I'm a big fan of anime and enjoy watching a wide variety of genres. From action to comedy, there's always something interesting to watch.
  
- **Reading**: Both manga and books are an important part of my life. I love getting lost in the pages of a good story and exploring different universes and perspectives.

These hobbies provide me with moments of entertainment and also inspire me in my work and programming projects.
